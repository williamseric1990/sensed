`sensed` is a sensor network daemon that acts as a provider for sensor and node data.

### Installation

`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sli/sensed/master/setup_sensed | sudo bash -`

If you don't like that method, then simply clone the repository and run `install.sh`. Be aware that NodeJS is
installed in the above manner, so you may want to install manually.
